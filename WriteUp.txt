If I were to expand the FoodTruckFinder class to be a web application rather than just a standalone command line utility, I would first split out various parts of the class into APIs.  For example, the overall main() method would become its own public API like getOpenFoodTrucks(), maybe adding parameters to accept times other than the current machine time e.g. getOpenFoodTrucks(Date someDate). A larger batch API could take in a List of Dates and return a Map from Date to List of open food trucks at each date.  Pagination would also likely be a consideration here; perhaps adding the ability to request a specific size of the List of open food trucks to return and also a start index for subsequent paginated calls.

The underlying government website we fetch from also features support for a number of different parameters to be passed through in the request URL, such as city, state, or zip code which could be used to just get results in a certain area.  For GPS based proximity, the location checking would need to happen within the FoodTruckFinder webservice as the government website only supports direct matching of input parameters e.g. state=WA but not latitude=[myLatitude-1, myLatitude+1].
