To run this program, you should only need the FoodTruckFinder.java file and the included GSON jar
All execution and input/output should occur in your terminal/console window

Example command to run (Unix):
$ javac -cp gson-2.2.2.jar FoodTruckFinder.java && java -cp .:gson-2.2.2.jar FoodTruckFinder

Example command to run (Windows):
$ javac -cp gson-2.2.2.jar FoodTruckFinder.java && java -cp .;gson-2.2.2.jar FoodTruckFinder

On Unix I had to explicitly define classpath for both javac and java commands, may not be needed on other systems
